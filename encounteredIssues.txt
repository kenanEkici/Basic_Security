codewise
what the hell is mean
no angular used
jade is a pita
how to use server libraries in browser
keep code clean and readable (javascript kek)
callback hell 
key management (how???) 
javascript VS jade compiler


securitywise
cookies = easy to change yourself
browser javascript = cross-site attacks
keys send in plain text 
no https (doesnt seem to work) 
avoid two different sessions
